Golden Hound is a Python/Pygame game written for Pyweek39. The theme was "Downstream".

Golden Hound is a game about a hungry dog that jumps into the water for fish. The setting is during the Californian gold rush, so I tried to convey the setting through my art and music.

## Game mechanics
- Eat fish or you die.
- Collect gold to beat levels.
- Bird eats your fish.
- Miner hurt you
- Rocks block you and push you and kill you if you're pushed off screen.
